      "Inspired by the harsh, frozen landscape of Siberia, you’ll traverse the unforgiving tundra, enter into the drunken forests and venture out on the frozen bay. Here, the weather can turn at an instant, leaving you swept in whirling snow and surrounded by cracking ice. Despite its grim appearance, Medved-Taiga National Park is bustling with life. You will find prey like Musk Deer, Reindeer (also known as Caribou in North America) and Wild Boar. But larger species also roam. The majestic Moose travels these plains, as does the fierce Brown Bear. Perhaps most unique of all - hunters in this reserve will face the highly intelligent and ghost-like Lynx. The open world of Medved-Taiga National Park measures 25 square miles (64 square kilometers), the same impressive size as Hirschfelden and Layton Lake District. It features a brand new, exciting narrative with 32 missions, 50 side missions and countless unique sights to discover. You take the role of an expert survivalist and hunter contracted to assist Alena Khasavovna and her scientific expedition. In addition to being a highly-trained climatologist, Alena hails from a reindeer herding people native to the region, offering her a unique insight into its challenges.",

Putting your dog to work gives it experience, which is used to progress through its 30 companion levels and 15 tracker levels. The more you hunt together, the more efficient it becomes. Your dog’s ability to focus is directly connected to the bond you share. Rewarding your companion by praising, petting, or giving it treats strengthens your bond, so make sure to show your four-legged friend some love after a good day’s hunt! You can name your dog, choose its fur coat variation, and pick what traits it should have. Add multiple dogs to your roster, and pick one to go hunting with.
